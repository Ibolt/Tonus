# Tonus
Musical analysis using machine learning. Tonus is a web app capable of identifying piano notes and guitar chords. 

## How it Works
A custom-trained Tensorflow Audio Recognition model is used to analyze audio. Uploaded files are converted into a [Mel Spectrogram](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/15-492/slides/03_mfcc.pdf) which are then classified using a convolutional neural network.
